# PMax & Shopping Alerts Script

A Google Ads script that monitors Performance Max campaigns and Shopping products, providing alerts for:
- Network spend distribution in PMax campaigns
- Disapproved products
- Out of stock products

## Features

### PMax Network Alerts

We all love the Mike Rhodes script, but we all hate opening spreadsheets to check network spend.
Well, this script is a modernized version of the Mike Rhodes script that sends alerts straight to your inbox.
So you only have to open the sheets when there are issues.

- Monitors spend distribution across networks (Display, YouTube, Search)
- Configurable thresholds for each network
- Email alerts when thresholds are exceeded

### Product Status Alerts
- Tracks disapproved products
- Monitors out-of-stock items
- Calculates potential revenue impact
- Detailed performance metrics for affected products

## Configuration

```javascript
const ALERT_EMAILS     = ['your.email@domain.com'];
const DISPLAY_THRESHOLD = 0.01;  // 1% of total spend
const VIDEO_THRESHOLD   = 0.01;  // 1% of total spend
const SEARCH_THRESHOLD  = 0.05;  // 5% of total spend
const GMC_ID           = YOUR_GMC_ID;
const MIN_CLICKS       = 1;

// Date range options: TODAY, YESTERDAY, LAST_7_DAYS, LAST_14_DAYS, LAST_30_DAYS
const PMAX_DATE_RANGE   = 'LAST_7_DAYS';
const SHOPPING_DATE_RANGE = 'LAST_7_DAYS';
